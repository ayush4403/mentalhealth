We should be excited, not scared, when we're in a desperate situation.

Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.

He who avoids the hardship of progress, is doomed to meet the pain of regret.

Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.

Know yourself and you will win all battles.

There will always be someone who can't see your value , don't let that someone be you.

Yesterday i was clever, so i wanted to change the world. Today i am wise, so i am changing myself.

Man conquers the world by conquering himself.

He who can not obey himself, will be commanded. that is the nature of living creatures.

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
