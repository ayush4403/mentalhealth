	b. Envision a beautiful and calm environment. Whatever comes to your mind that feels good and relaxing is right. It could, for example, be 
	   a green forest, a quiet beach under the sun or stars, or a snowy mountain with the sun on your face and a gentle breeze against your back.
	c. Imagine the details, smells and sounds of your peaceful place. Move around and explore it.
	d. Take two to three minutes to relax here.
	e.  When you feel ready, focus again on how it feels to breathe in and out. Then return to your day more relaxed.
	

2. Breathing Exercise : It helps by promoting relaxation through the extended exhalation, which triggers the body's natural relaxation response. 

	a. Take a deep and slow breath in, inhaling through your nose, whilst counting to 3 in your head.
	b. Hold your breath there for 5 seconds.
	c. Then slowly breath out through your mouth. While doing this, count to 6 in your head.

	Repeat from step 1 three more times and take this feeling of calm with you into your day.
	

3. Relaxing your eyes : Relaxing your eyes is an important part of overall relaxation, especially if you spend a lot of time looking at screens or 
						engaging in activities that strain your eyes. 

	a. Rub the palms of your hands together until you feel warm.
	b. Place your palms over your closed eyes, feel the warmth, breathe in and out through your stomach five times slowly and deeply and enjoy this 
	   little wellness for your eyes.
	   
	   
4. Progressive muscle relaxation : It is a technique that involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in the body to release
								   physical tension and promote relaxation.
								 
	a. Sit or lie down in a quiet, comfortable place where you won't be disturbed.
	b. Start by taking a few slow, deep breaths to relax your body and mind.
	c. Begin at your toes and work your way up, or start at the top of your head and move down—whichever feels more natural for you. Tense each muscle group 
	   for about 5-10 seconds, then release and relax for 20-30 seconds. 
	   You can follow this sequence:

		Toes and feet: Curl your toes and tighten the muscles in your feet.
		Calves and thighs: Flex your feet upward, then tighten your calf muscles and then your thighs.
		Buttocks: Squeeze the muscles in your buttocks.
		Abdomen: Tighten your abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button toward your spine.
		Chest and back: Take a deep breath, hold it for a moment, then release.
		Shoulders: Raise your shoulders toward your ears to tense the muscles.
		Arms and hands: Clench your fists and tighten the muscles in your arms.
		Face: Scrunch your face, squinting your eyes, clenching your jaw, and wrinkling your nose.
	d. As you release each muscle group, focus on the sensation of relaxation and let go of any tension. Notice the difference between the tension and relaxation
   	   in each muscle group.
    e. After going through each muscle group, you can repeat the process if you feel tension in any specific area. Finally, take a few deep breaths and slowly 
	   open your eyes if they were closed.
	   
	   
5. Sleep Better at night : This is the best way to always start the day well rested and refreshed!
	
	a. Do not eat heavy meals in the evening because increased gastrointestinal activity can make sleep more restless.
	b. If possible, try to go to bed and get up at the same time, even on weekends - your body will adopt this rhythm and your well-being will increase as a result.
	c. Before going to bed, don't watch TV, smartphone and tablet. They make you restless and disturb your night's sleep. The blue light components also prevent the 
	   production of the sleep hormone melatonin.
	d. Introduce a personal sleep ritual, such as drinking a cup of herbal tea, relaxation techniques or meditation. This way you give your body and your psyche a 
	   clear signal: it's soon bedtime.
	   
	  
6. Emotion labeling : It is a technique used in emotional regulation and mindfulness practices. It involves identifying and labeling your emotions in a descriptive 
                      and non-judgmental way.
					  
	a. Take 3 deep breaths.
	b. Go into yourself: What are you feeling right now?
	c. Try to label your feelings. Often other emotions are hiding behind the first facade: Can you recognise them? Is there only anger or perhaps sadness or even 
	   disappointment? Try to give names to all your emotions. This will help you to have better control of your emotions and your reaction to them.
	d. Now close your eyes and repeat this exercise again slowly and deliberately. Take your time.
	Open your eyes again and return to your everyday life more calm and relaxed.
	
	
7. Cognitive reappraisal : It is a powerful psychological technique used to manage emotions by changing the way we perceive a situation or stimulus. It involves 
                           reinterpreting the meaning or significance of an event to alter its emotional impact.
						   
	a. Breathe deeply and take a moment for this exercise.

	b. Relax and open your mind as much as you can, because you'll have to get creative now.

	c. Mentally reimagine the situation that is bothering you.

	   Oftentimes, when we are in a state of intense emotion, our thinking becomes very one-sided. Intense sadness blocks out all thoughts that are not intensely 
	   sad. The same applies to other emotions.

	d. Now try to gain a new perspective on the upsetting situation. You can ask yourself the following questions:

		What advantages does it bring?

		What could I understand differently?

		What can I be happy about despite everything?

		The cognitive reappraisal can be difficult, but if you change the course of your thoughts or the way you look at the current situation, the course and, above all,
		the intensity of your emotions can also change.

	e. Give yourself time to explore the situation and look at it from different angles. If it helps you, close your eyes while doing so.

	Now allow yourself to go through the rest of the day feeling more calm and relaxed.
	
	
8. Center yourself : Centering oneself to be present in the moment involves techniques to bring your focus and awareness to the present, allowing you to let go of 
                     distractions and cultivate a sense of mindfulness.
					 
	a. Sit comfortably and close your eyes.
	b. Take a couple of deep breaths in through your nose (count to 3), out through your mouth (count to 3).
	c. Open your eyes and look around.
	d. In a mindful and present way, name out loud:
		- 5 things you can see around you
		- 4 things you can feel
		- 3 things you can hear
		- 2 things you can smell
		- 1 thing you can taste
	e. Take a deep breath to conclude the exercise.


9. The STOP method : It is a mindfulness technique used to cultivate greater awareness and presence in the moment.

	a. S: Stop. Pause whatever you're doing. This can be a physical pause or a mental pause—just a moment to halt your actions or thoughts.
	b. T: Take a breath. Take a few intentional, deep breaths. This step helps bring your focus to the present moment and calms your mind.
	c. O: Observe. Take notice of what's happening within you and around you. Observe your thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and the environment without judgment.
		  Acknowledge what is present in this moment.
	d. P: Proceed mindfully. After taking a pause, breathing, and observing, proceed with your next actions or thoughts more mindfully and consciously. Consider how you
  	      want to respond rather than react automatically.
		  
	The STOP method is a simple but effective way to interrupt automatic or habitual reactions and bring yourself back to the present moment. It can be used in various 
	situations throughout the day to increase self-awareness, reduce stress, and make more conscious choices in your actions and interactions.
	
	
10. Write it down : It  is a simple yet effective strategy to enhance clarity, organization, and mindfulness. It involves putting thoughts, tasks, emotions, or ideas onto
					paper or a digital medium.This practice helps us to release our emotions and feelings and helps our self-development. Just by writing emotions on paper 
					we accept them more easily, which is a key part of mindfulness.

					
	a. Sit down somewhere quiet and peaceful, where you feel safe and can focus.
	b. Take a few deep breaths in to arrive in the present moment.
	c. Begin writing your thoughts. Whatever you think, you write.
	Remember, the key is not to judge. Instead, let your writing flow freely.
	
	
11. Positive self-talk :  It involves using affirming and constructive language when speaking to yourself or thinking internally. It's a powerful technique that can influence 
						  your mindset, emotions, and behaviors. 
						  
	a. Recognise what you are saying to yourself. For example: "I will never manage to remember all of that."
	b. Try and stop the negative thoughts by using cues: snap your fingers and tell yourself "no", for example.
	c. Reason with yourself and focus on what you CAN do.
	d. Turn the phrase into a positive one. For example: "I am capable of remembering all the important things."
	
	
12. Distance from the emotions : Creating distance from emotions is often associated with techniques from mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral approaches.

	a. Take several deep breaths.
	b. Ask yourself: "How is [your name] doing right now?"
	c. Try to answer this question about yourself in the third person. Although it may feel strange at first, it can be very helpful to think about ourselves as we would about 
	   other people. This gives us the necessary distance from our experiences, which is essential for successful emotion control.
	d. If it feels better for you, close your eyes now. Give yourself a moment to relax, go inside yourself and answer this question about [your name] as honestly as possible.
	Now open your eyes. Feel the newfound calm and go back to your day relaxed.
	
	These techniques can aid in developing emotional resilience and better coping strategies.
	
	
13. Just Like Me : It is a mindfulness practice designed to cultivate empathy, compassion, and understanding towards others. This technique involves mentally recognizing the shared 
                   humanity and common experiences between yourself and others.

	a. Think of someone—whether a friend, acquaintance, or even someone you find challenging or difficult.
	b. Repeat the phrase "Just like me, this person..." and complete the sentence with an observation or a common human experience. For example:
		"Just like me, this person wants to be happy."
		"Just like me, this person experiences joy, pain, and sorrow."
		"Just like me, this person seeks love and connection."
		"Just like me, this person faces challenges and struggles."
		"Just like me, this person worries."
		"Just like me, this person is frightend sometimes."
		"Just like me, this person has felt unworthy or inadequeate at times."
	c. Reflect on the similarities you share with this person, acknowledging that despite differences in circumstances or behavior, at a fundamental level, you both share common emotions,
	   desires, and experiences.
	d. Allow yourself to generate feelings of empathy and compassion towards the person. This practice helps soften judgments and fosters a more empathetic perspective.
	Apply this technique regularly, especially when interacting with others or when facing conflicts or disagreements. It can help shift your mindset from a place of judgment to one of 
	understanding and empathy.
